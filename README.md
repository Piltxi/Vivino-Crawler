## ü•Ç Usage <a name="usage"></a>
### üìñ Options
WineTz shows all available features.
```
python3 crawler.py -h
```
WineTz deletes output information and recovered reviews. The */out* directory will be deleted. 
```
python3 crawler.py -r
```
WineTz allows you to specify filtering options for your search. 
```
python3 crawler.py -s
```
WineTz will load the search parameters from a file in the *input/* directory.
If nothing is entered, WineTz loads the parameters from the */input/parameters.json* file. <br>
**Important:** <br> Format of the file to attach is that of the file automatically exported during scraping: */out/parameters.json*
```
python3 crawler.py -f
```
WineTz prints additional information while running. **This option is useful and recommended during debugging.**
```
python3 crawler.py -v
```
WineTz acquires filtering parameters in a special way.
**This option must be specialized towards the target of interest.**
You can change WineTz search filters by using the ***src/command.py*** **module.** and ***production()*** **function**. 
```
python3 crawler.py -p
```
### ‚öñÔ∏è Start crawling
When WineTz starts its tasks, it prints the number of matches obtained through requests to the *vivino.com* API.
Afterwards, you will see a progress bar describing the progress of the review retrieval.

WineTz creates an output folder */out*. Inside */out* create a directory for each exported dataset.<br>
Inside the *dataset directory*, WineTz exports three *.csv* files: wines, style and reviews:

*wine.csv* contains information about wines <br> *style.csv* provides information on wine styles <br> *reviews.csv* the reviews of each wine.

Automatically, a fourth *.json* file is created: *parameters.json*.<br>
This file contains the parameters used for scraping. By copying this file to the *crawler/input/*, you can scrape with the same search parameters.

Happy scraping!
